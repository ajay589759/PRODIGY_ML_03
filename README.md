# PRODIGY_ML_03

**Cat-Dog Classification with PyTorch**
This repository contains a deep learning project for classifying images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with PyTorch. The project includes data loading, model training, evaluation, and final classification.

**Project Structure**
data/: Directory containing test images for final classification.
batch_files/: Directory containing preprocessed training and test batches.
model/: Directory where the trained model will be saved.
tensor.py: Main script containing the implementation of the model and training/testing procedures.
**Requirements:-
Python 3.6+,
PyTorch,
NumPy,
OpenCV.
Pickle.**
